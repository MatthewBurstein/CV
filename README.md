For the past 5 years I have been working for a Homeless charity, first as part of a dynamic new project, the Recovery College, and then as a database administrator. In the latter role, I worked closely with the in-house developer and was able to explore the deep satisfaction I derive from understanding and constructing complex and elegant logical systems.

Following these experiences, and with great excitement, I have embarked upon the Makers Academy bootcamp, wherein I will immerse myself in learning the skills, technologies and best practices needed to begin my journey as a developer.

#### Excellent interpersonal communication

In my previous role, I received high praise from all levels of the organisation for over a hundred pages of in-depth guidance for technical systems, which I wrote and published for users of the database. I also delivered bespoke monthly training for users and worked closely with other technical staff to solve cross-platform issues as they arose.

My communication skills allow me to maintain strong and positive working relationships with all my colleagues which makes collaboration a pleasure. To quote feedback from a former colleague submitted as part of my appraisal:

>"Matt has got to be one of the kindest and friendliest people I have ever worked with."

#### Logical problem-solving

Using a CRM platform as the client database of a homeless charity presented a number of challenges as the system was bent to a new purpose. I excelled in using the tools provided by the platform to meet the varied needs of the organisation, for example implementing case management and support plan processes for our clients across multi-tier data structures.

#### Self-study

I have successfully taught myself a variety of complex skills, including Salesforce, Adobe InDesign and an array of sophisticated music production software. During a period of short staffing at St Mungo's, I was asked to create reports for senior management using SQL Server, which I had not used before. Under considerable time pressure I taught myself the skills necessary to retrieve the data according to the specification provided.

#### Dynamic innovation

I joined the Recovery College early on. At that time, we were a team of two staff implementing a paradigm never before seen in the sector. I created systems and processes for much of the service, from producing the prospectus, to collecting, recording and analysing data, to managing student wellbeing. This challenge was an amazing opportunity to learn about building something from scratch while maintaining a focus on the people we were supporting. During my time there, we developed the College from a fledgling service into one receiving international praise and attention as we hosted visitors from the Netherlands, the Czech Republic and Australia.

#### Interpreting logical structures and understanding their implications

The platform on which St Mungo's database was built often provided new modules for the system. I was responsible for studying these updates and identifying any risks their implementation might pose. If I deemed them problematic, I would build the functionality safely myself. I loved discovering the structure of these modules, and I look forward to exploring this skill further as a developer.
